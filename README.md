# mypyutils
A personal repository for analysis functions relevant for initialized prediction work.

## Python environment
I use this with mypythonenv.

## Installing mypyutils
From within your local mypyutils directory and after activating your environment run
```bash
pip install -e . --user
```
Then when you're using this environment, all the modules will be available for you to import
